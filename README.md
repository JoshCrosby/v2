# WaSQL - Web access to SQL

## What is WaSQL?
WaSQL is web application platform currently written in PHP with a few supporting files written in Perl.  It is designed to help you build web sites, forms, e-commerce, intranet and other custom web applications rapidly.  WaSQL deploys pages and applications using a database driven MVC architecture.  It is a stand-alone platform as it does not require any outside or 3rd party add-ons to work.  It is also a replacement for PhpMyAdmin since database schema management is built in.  User management is also built in.

## Required Skills
To use WaSQL effectively you need to know HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript SQL, and PHP.  Many functions are already built for you but you need to understand programming logic to really use it.  

## Best Way to Learn WaSQL
I have found that the best way to learn WaSQL is to download it and use it.  I also recommend reading the functions found in database.php and common.php for starters.
