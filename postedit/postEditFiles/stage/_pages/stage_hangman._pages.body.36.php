					<h1>Hangman</h1>
					<p>First mentioned in a book by Alice Bertha Gromme in 1894, no one knows exactly where the game of Hangman originated.  But this old school spelling game played with paper and pencil has moved into the 21st century with our new hands-free audio version. 
						Using the Amazon Echo&trade; family of devices, just ask Alexa to "Start Hangman" and prepare to be educated and entertained.
					</p>
					<p>First she'll ask whether you would like to choose the word length (from 3 to 31) or to pick from a category of words. The categories you can select from include:
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="w_bold">Parts of Speech:</span> Adjectives, Adverbs, Nouns or Verbs<br />
						<span class="w_bold">The Natural World:</span> Anatomy, Fruits and Vegetables, Periodic Elements, Trees or Wildlife<br />
						<span class="w_bold">The Kitchen Sink:</span> Colors, Cooking Terms, Musical Instruments, Occupations, or Transportation
					</p>
					<p>Alexa will help you keep track of your guesses along the way. If you forget and ask for a letter you already guessed, she'll let you know and it won't count as a miss. You get 6 misses total. If you need help visualizing the word, you can always play
					along with the Alexa app on your phone or computer at <a href="http://alexa.amazon.com/" target="alexa">http://alexa.amazon.com/</a> where the word you are playing is listed along with how many tries you have left.
