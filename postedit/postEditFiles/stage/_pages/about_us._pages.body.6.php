	<h2>About Us</h2>
	Based in Salt Lake City, our team has more than 65 years of business and technology experience between us. 
	Over the years, we've worked for enterprise companies with global reach like Intel to innovative startups that sadly didn't survive.
	Individually, we've run our own businesses, striving to reach financial success alone. 
	We have nothing but admiration for the many solopreneurs and small concerns out there, working every day to achieve the dream. 
	In fact, one of our biggest goals as a company is to help those business owners by sharing our technical knowledge and business experience, what we've seen work and where we've failed in the past, while providing quality software that supports those efforts.
	<p><p>
 	 We aren't looking to be the next <a target="dict" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)">unicorn</a>.
	 Achieving work/life balance is another goal we strongly believe in making a reality.
	 So, while our primary focus is to provide premium business productivity apps at an affordable price, we also want to have fun along the way.
	 That's why you'll see a mix of offerings from us including free games and entertaining apps that have little to do with work and the business of making money.
	 Our games are things we have a lot of fun making and using ourselves.
	<p><p>
	We sincerely hope you enjoy what we're creating at Skillsai, and that you'll join us in working AND playing hard. 
	Please let us hear from you about what you're doing in your own business, what new skills you would like us to build, and any other ways we can help. 
	Life is not a zero-sum game--we're going for the win-win!
